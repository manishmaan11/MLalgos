# MLalgos
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms developed from scratch using only basic Python libraries (without relying on built-in ML packages such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch). The goal of this repository is to provide a deeper understanding of how different ML algorithms work by implementing them manually.

Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to help you better understand the mechanics of machine learning algorithms by walking through their implementation from scratch. By building these models without relying on high-level libraries, we get a clearer view of the underlying math and logic that drives machine learning.

These implementations serve as a learning resource for students, practitioners, and anyone interested in exploring the foundations of ML. The code is written in Python, with no external libraries beyond NumPy for numerical computations.

Algorithms Implemented
Below is a list of machine learning algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

Supervised Learning
Linear Regression
Simple implementation of linear regression to predict continuous values.

Logistic Regression
Binary classification using logistic regression with gradient descent.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple KNN algorithm for classification based on proximity to nearest data points.

Decision Trees
Recursive binary tree structure used for classification and regression tasks.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A classifier that works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points.

Naive Bayes Classifier
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions.

Unsupervised Learning
K-Means Clustering
Unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters.

Hierarchical Clustering
Agglomerative clustering method that builds a hierarchy of clusters.

Neural Networks & Deep Learning
Single-layer Perceptron (SLP)
Basic implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer for binary classification tasks.
Reinforcement Learning
Q-Learning
Basic implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for reinforcement learning.
Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy (for numerical operations)
You can install NumPy by running the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy
Clone the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch.git
cd ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch
Usage
After cloning the repository, you can start running individual scripts that implement each algorithm. Each script is named after the algorithm it implements.

For example, to run the Linear Regression implementation, execute the following:

bash
Copy
python linear_regression.py
Example: Running Linear Regression from Scratch
python
Copy
import numpy as np

# Load your dataset here (X = features, y = target)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])  # Example feature matrix
y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Example target values

# Call the Linear Regression function
theta = linear_regression(X, y)

print(f"Learned Parameters: {theta}")
